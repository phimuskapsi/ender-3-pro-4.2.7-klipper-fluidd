# Dual Z-Axis upgrade notes

In Klipper, there is no particular setup you need to do for this. 
If you want you can look into the UART mod for the silent 4.2.7 Creality board or the 4.2.2. This can be modified to allow for individual stepper motor control.

Calibration notes:
When I first installed this the tilt was pretty severe after a Bed Mesh calibration.
The max side of X was -2.5mm and the min side was -1.0 or more. 

Rather than screw around with the springs, make sure your Z-steppers are strongly attached, then when pressing down on the screw for the Z, you can manually turn the stepper.
I have found that a general rule of thumb is one turn is around 0.01mm. If you are negative, you need to turn it so the gantry goes down, positive it needs to go up.
